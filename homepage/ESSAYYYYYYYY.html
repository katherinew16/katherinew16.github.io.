My Spot by The River

It’s funny that I call it my spot because it wasn’t originally mine. It had been there my whole life but I wasn’t looking.  To me it was just a part of the river I had run by hundreds of times, just a desolate corner where people sometimes fished. My neighbor brought me and my sister to that spot when I was in eighth grade. Originally, it was a strain for me to find the beauty in it. To get in I had to push past a rusty gate to find a dangerously abrupt ledge leading to the East River and a graffiti covered wall that chipped and left flakes on my back when I leaned against it. None of those things ever changed, but my perspective did. I realized that the gate made the spot hidden and unknown to the rest of the city, and the dangerous ledge had a perfect curve that formed a natural talking pit, and that wall had my back more than some of the friends I brought there.
After my neighbor brought us, it was clear to me that it was going to be my spot, but if someone hadn’t shown me, I would have never found it. That was one of the best things about the spot: you had to be shown. I could tell people about it and where to go but, in order to get there, I had to bring them. This made it that much more private, because I knew no matter how long I sat there or how loud I was, no one could find me. When you are completely alone, you can be yourself, and the spot allowed me to do that. I shared with it my triumphs and my losses. I showed it my love and my pain. My steadfast, and trustworthy spot never wavered. It was always there, the gate slightly open, waiting for me.
I was lucky to find a sanctuary in such a restless and active city. The spot acted as an escape from all things trying and intimidating. The millions of people that I shared the city with faded away as I pushed open the gate and entered my own Narnia. I formed my true appreciation for it during the pandemic. The panic pouring through the city seemed to have passed it by. I could escape from my family and from this new, isolated life that I wasn't yet ready to accept. During a time filled with such darkness, the spot was my light. Even alone, I could never feel lonely in the company of my spot.
It was only after the spot was clearly established to be mine that I started to bring friends. It was a difficult balance of wanting it to be mine and only mine, and wanting to share its charm. I was so selective of who I brought there, it was an exclusive club and I was the bouncer. I only brought people that I knew would be able to fully grasp the beauty of the spot, and there is no one that I took who didn't adore it. Once we squeezed past the gate, we were encapsulated in the sunset, the leaves would give a welcoming wave through the wind, and the waves of the river never stopped dancing with us. My friends and I would swell the spot with music and laughter until it would seep into cracks on the ground.
 Just as I had taken the spot from someone else, it was taken from me. One day it was there, and the next, it was gone. The City was building a park over my spot. I wish I could have run to the construction workers and made them stop. Stop them from ripping up my rusty gate. Stop them from shattering my dangerous ledge. Stop them from covering my graffitied wall. They destroyed everything, except the memories that I had made. Those will stand for longer than any gate could and paint a picture that graffiti could never compare to. Now everytime I walk past the construction site, I get a rush of the memories from my spot that no one could ever destroy .
